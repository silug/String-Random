Revision history for Perl extension String::Random.

0.1992  - Added support for {n,m} ranges in regular expressions.
        - Cleaned up the initialization of @punct.

0.1991  - Added a "b" for random binary data in randpattern().

0.199 
	- fixed randregex() and randpattern() to Do The Right
	  Thing(TM) when called in an array or scalar context, and
	  when passed multiple arguments
	  (* WARNING *  This is an incompatible change.  Code
	  expecting the behavior of earlier versions may break.  Of
	  course, the documentation warned that this change would be
	  made, and everybody reads documentation, right?  :-)
	- fixed use of $_ in randpattern()
	  (Unfortunately, there's still one use of $_ in a grep(), but
	  I don't see how that can be avoided, and it only happens
	  once on initialization.)

	- fixed \W generating "_"
	- reorganized a bit to make it easier to add more patterns
