0.22   2006-09-21
    - Fix README to reflect current reality.
    - Random cleanup in this file.
    - Since we've broken compatibility with *really* old Perl5 anyway,
      modernize a bit more ("our" instead of "use vars").  Also
      explicitly require 5.6.1.

    - Modify test.pl to use Test::More.
    - Build with Module::Build.
    - Minor whitespace cleanup.
    - Avoid undefined results from randregex() and randpattern().
    - Turn on warnings in the module.

0.20   2003-09-29
    - Added support for *, +, and ? in regular expressions.

0.1992 2002-07-25
    - Added support for {n,m} ranges in regular expressions.
    - Cleaned up the initialization of @punct.

0.1991 2002-02-28
    - Added a "b" for random binary data in randpattern().

0.199  2002-02-26
    - fixed randregex() and randpattern() to Do The Right Thing(TM)
      when called in an array or scalar context, and when passed
      multiple arguments.
      (* WARNING * This is an incompatible change. Code expecting the
      behavior of earlier versions may break. Of course, the documentation
      warned that this change would be made, and everybody reads
      documentation, right? :-)
    - fixed use of $_ in randpattern().
      (Unfortunately, there's still one use of $_ in a grep(), but I don't
      see how that can be avoided, and it only happens once on
      initialization.)

0.198  2000-05-16
    - fixed \W generating "_"
    - reorganized a bit to make it easier to add more patterns
    - added \s and \S
    - added two-character literals (\t, \n, \r, \f, \a, \e)

0.197  1999-07-10
    - moved most of randregex() to %regch
    - added random_regex() function interface

    - first pass of regex support

0.1    1998-09-10
